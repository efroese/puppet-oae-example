This is a set of puppet scripts to stand up an OAE cluster.

The OAE module itself is available at https://github.com/efroese/puppet.oae.git.

The required modules are included as git submodules.

Most of them are from http://github.com/camptocamp.
I've forked some of them into http://github.com/efroese when necessary.
